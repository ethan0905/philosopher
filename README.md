> Philosophers are sitting around a table where there is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle. They all bring their own fork.
> **They can alternatively eat, sleep or think.** But in order to eat, they need to use 2 forks.
> 
> In a multi-threading manner, you gonna find a way to **prevent any philosopher from dying.**

 - [❗️ Tricky tests](#%EF%B8%8F-tricky-tests)

## ❗️ Tricky tests
| TEST | How philosopher should react |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `./philo 1 800 200 200` | The philosopher should not eat and should die! |
| `./philo 5 800 200 200`  | No one should die! |
| `./philo 5 800 200 200 7` | No one should die and the simulation should stop when all the philosophers has eaten at least 7 times each |
| `./philo 4 410 200 200` | No one should die! |
| `./philo 4 310 200 100`  | A philosopher should die! |
| `./philo 5 800 200 150`  | No one should die! |
| `./philo 3 610 200 80`  | No one should die! |

If for the last 2 tests, you have philo dying, it means that you are still missing something in order to solve the dinning philosopher problem.
How to solve it ?
````c
void  think(t_philo *philo)
{
	display(philo, "is thinking");
  
  	// We create a time_to_think delay, that prevent the current philo to take forks
 	// and eat directly after finishing to sleep.
  	// formula: ((time_to_die - (time_to_eat + time_to_sleep)) / 2) * 1000;
	
	usleep(((philo->data->time_to_die - (philo->data->time_to_eat \
	+ philo->data->time_to_sleep)) / 2) * 1000);
}
````

## ⚙️ How to run the project ?
Compile using:
````shell
make
````
Then start a simulation using:
````shell
./philo <nb_philo> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep> <nb_of_time_each_philo_must_eat> //last argument is facultative
````  

## 🗃️ Data races
To check data races, go into your Makefile and use *-fsanitize=thread* when you compile. You can either check them using:
````shell
valgrind --tool=helgrind ./philo arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4
````
